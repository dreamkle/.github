SHARE DREAMS
- There are two meanings to dreams - the one you dream at night and one you wish to come true - and we love both!
- What's your dream? What do you wish? Writing it down is the first step to approach it.
- Lucid dreaming? Woke up from a weird dream? Write down your dream that you had last night as detailed as possible. A lot of people on Dreamkle use it as a dream journal. When you log your important dreams, you can recall and analyze them. Our dream journal allows you to keep your dreams private in your own dreaming diary. Or, you can post and share your dreams with others. 


Tbh, this is the kind of social media that REAL FRIENDS use.


Want to know who finds your story fascinating? Your friends and fans can interact with you by liking or commenting on your story. 


Dreamkle is all you need to express your creativity!


Happy Dreamkling!
